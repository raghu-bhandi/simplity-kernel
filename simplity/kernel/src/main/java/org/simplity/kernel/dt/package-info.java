/**
 * A data-type is a design component. It captures the restrictions on the range of values a field
 * can have. In this package, we implement those aspects of data-type that are relevant for
 * delivering service from server side. That is, the classes defined here MAY NOT have all
 * attributes of data-type design component. They only have those that are required by the server
 * side. For example we do not deal with formatting.
 *
 * <p>It is important to understand the relationship between value-types and data-types. A data-type
 * has an underlying value-type. Data-type puts further restriction on the possible values.
 *
 * <p>For example an integerDataType with its maxValue set to 3578 implies: 1. that the value has to
 * be an integer. 2. Further, it can have a maximum value of 3578.
