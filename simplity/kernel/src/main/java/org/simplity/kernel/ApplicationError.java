/**
 * represents an application design error. We have decided to make it an unchecked exception because
 * there is no reason for this error to occur at run time, except that the programmer has not run
 * design-time validations. This is like syntax error in a script language. We expect that the
 * project has put reasonable build procedure to catch such errors. Examples are missing components,
 * incompatible data-types etc..
 *
 * <p>Even sql exceptions are not to be handled at the component level, they are actually re-thrown
 * as ApplicationExcption We would like to catch all such exceptions at the highest level and deal
 * with them rather than each component worrying about it.
