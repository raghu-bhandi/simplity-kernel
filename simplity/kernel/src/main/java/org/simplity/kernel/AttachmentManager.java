/**
 * Most corporate have central service that stores files. Attachment Manager is the interface

 *
 * <p>Process to upload a file.
 *
 * <p>1. client uploads the file thru attachmentAgent who in-turn uses this class to save the file
 * into temp storage, and returns a key to client.
 *
 * <p>2. client uses this key as part of its data while submitting data to server as part of its
 * save transaction
 *
 * <p>3. HttpAgent copies all saved media in session to serviceData while requesting service from
 * app layer.
 *
 * <p>4. service has to know about the field in which this key us expected from client. This is
 * specified as part of InputData specification. This class is invoked by the service to save the
 * attachment into permanent storage. This key is stored as part of transaction data record in
 * RDBMS.
 *
 * <p>process to send a file to client.
 *
 * <p>1. Service retrieves all data from db, including the storage token for the file.
 *
 * <p>2. Field that represent such a key are specified as part of OutputData specification. Service
 * uses this class to retrieve the stored attachment into a temp area. Value of the field is changed
 * to this new temp-key.
 *
 * <p>3. client application has to have the knowledge about the field that has the key for file to
 * be downloaded. It calls back the AttachmentAgent to down load the file to client. This is a get
 * method that is easy to be used as url for image or url for a new window
