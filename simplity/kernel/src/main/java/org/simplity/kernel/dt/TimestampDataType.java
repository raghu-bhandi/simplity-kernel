/**
 * timestamp is a pseudo data type, because it is actually a numeric field, but it corresponds to an
 * RDBMS field defined as timestamp. JDBC, in our opinion, created a mess by defining timestamp as
 * an extension of Date field, but not exactly. Confusion is that if you cast Timestamp to Date then
 * you loose the entire second, not just the nano-part of it. Hence we treat it as long internally,
 * but allow users to treat it as date as well. Nano second is relevant only if the caller treats it
 * as long.
 *
 * <p>Also, time-stamp is used for checking whether the record is stale/dirty before updating.
 * Hence, it is important that we do not loose the nano-part while transporting it between server
 * and client. Hence simplity uses this as if it is a number.
